# Shopping List Domain Model

**Note:** This is a work in progress.

[Shopping List](https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/shopping-list) is a series of Offline First demo apps, each built using a different stack. This is a JavaScript implementation of the domain model for the Shopping List app. This package should be used in Vanilla JS, Polymer, React, Preact, Vue.js, Ember.js, React Native, Ionic, Cordova, Electron, and any other JavaScript implementations of the Shopping List demo app.
